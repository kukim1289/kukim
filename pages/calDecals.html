										<h1>CalDecals</h1>

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>Cal decals was a personal project that I pursued based off of my personal hobby of motorcycling. Imitating the logo littered bikes of Motogp, I purchased several decals off of ebay when I decided to learn the business behind it. I quickly learned the process of using a die cut machine from bleeding the decals and utilizing transfer tape. </p>

									<h2>Business Strategy</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/caldecal/marketing.png" alt="" /></span>Meme culture involves a series of tagging among a group of friends. When a person finds a funny meme, they tag a friend, and that friend tags yet another. This self induced sequential domino effect of tagging served as the marketing strategy I sought to employ. My first post on the Berkeley Free and For Sale Page combined meme culture with hydroflasks. Of the many essential necessities for college students, hydroflasks are undeniably one of them; students often place a myriad of stickers on their hydroflasks to display their interests and to prevent it from being lost among the thousands of bare hydroflasks. </p>
									<p>My first decal read: “Oof”. I sold smol, medium, and Big “Oof”s for 2, 3, and 4 dollars respectively; raw materials to create a small “Oof” was 4 cents. As my first decal post drew attention from a few hundred students, I started making decals from a variety of meme sayings such as “Mood” and “Sksksksk”. I described the sizing according to the manner in which the sayings are typically used. I.e. If I forget to wear long pants to my lab class, it is the perfect moment for my lab mate to say “Big oof”. When a person states “Big Oof”, they are referring to an insurmountable feeling of hopelessness, but in an insensitive manner. ”Sksksks” is a popular phrase used among “Vsco girls”, a group of individuals who are stereotyped to carry around Hydroflasks and an excessive amount of scrunchies. I intentionally utilized a bright green Hydroflask in my second post and expanded my fan base to a few thousand students. In the end, I gained 17% over my initial investment after a month of operations. Although a profit of $37.40 off of a starting investment of $219.05 is seen to many as an insignificant amount, if I were to invest the same amount in the S&P500 over the same duration, I would be in the red by 1.35%. </p>

									<h2>Biggest Challenge</h2>
									<p>The biggest challenge was choosing a convenient time and place to meet with a customer. The market was primarily college students, so it was difficult to match schedules with other students to make a hand to hand exchange. Another difficult task was to minimize the time of creating the decals. Although the margin of profit was beyond 1000%, it was difficult to actually compare the project to a part time job since I was essentially making 9-10$ per hour. </p>

									<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
									<p>The project was a prime example of how I could invest small sums of money and make a reasonable profit as long as I was willing to sacrifice time and effort into the marketing campaign/business idea. CalDecals was definitely out of my domain since I am a biologist who is not astute in design or photoshop. I believe that my solo venture into CalDecals was satisfying since I learned more about marketing strategies, while also creating forms of expression for myself and other students.</p>
