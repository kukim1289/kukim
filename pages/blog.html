					<h2>Liquor, Sweat, and Bulletproof Glass</h2>
					<p>Embracing Identity</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/Dad.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>A mile east of where the 5 merges with the San Bernardino freeway is Duke’s Sportsman Liquor
						store. Duke and Sunny, my middle aged parents from South Korea, owned the small liquor store in
						the city of Terrace for nearly a decade. Sitting on a stool behind the hanging rolls of
						scratchers, I watched my parents work. My dad, with his toes exposed in his velcro sandals,
						greeted customers while talking with the Budweiser courier about the day’s shipment. My mother
						stood at the counter behind the bullet proof glass for hours on end, shifting her weight from
						one leg to the other to spare her aching muscles. Occasionally, a regular customer walked in and
						greeted me. “Duke Junior” is the title I was given as I had some of my father’s strong Korean
						features: monolids and pronounced cheekbones. Around sunset, my mother and I left the store. As
						we reversed out of the parking lot, my father stood and waved goodbye. On the radio was 50
						cent’s “In da Club” and my mother left the windows of the Chevy wide open almost as if she was
						letting the wind evaporate the day’s sweat.</p>
					<p>My parents eventually sold Duke’s Sportsman Liquor Store and moved onto a larger business in
						2005. Royalty Market, located in the heart of South Central LA on 62nd and San Pedro, was much
						different than Duke’s liquor. The glass got thicker, the ailes grew larger, and the weekends
						were no longer spent as a spectator as I frequented Ace wholesale with my mother to pick up a
						variety of vegetables, sodas, dairy, and cigarettes. We were regulars at the wholesale. The
						workers gave my mother a suitable nickname: “Royalty!”, but I retained my title as Duke Junior.
						With an increased workload, my parents placed a queen size bed in the storage attic to sleep
						overnight, while leaving my sister and me with my grandma back at home in the San Fernando
						Valley. This was the busiest and most dangerous period in my parents’ lives. An altercation with
						a customer led to a black eye and missing front teeth for my father. It was a common sight to
						see red salonpas along the back of my father’s neck or around my mother’s forearms.</p>
					<p>Jug Jug Sports Bar and Restaurant in the San Fernando Valley was my parents’ last business
						venture together. After three years of opening the restaurant, my parents divorced, and I lived
						with my mother and sister. As a middle schooler too consumed in my own dramatic friend groups, I
						spent time neither with my mother who worked full time as a social worker at a nursing home nor
						with my father who worked tirelessly at the Korean-American fusion bar. Senior year in
						highschool/freshman year in college was an essential period for both my father’s restaurant and
						me. The restaurant, after serving customers for nearly 5 years, required a new food safety
						certificate, supplemented with a strict health inspection. Greasy fingers and sore wrists from
						scraping under the fryer or the stinging sensation in my nostrils from bleach was a common side
						effect of working full time at the restaurant. My father repeated himself quite often about how
						“there’s nothing to be embarrassed about working in a kitchen and washing dishes”. I responded
						with silence. Placing my phone on the dish rack and playing 2000s rap was my attempt at
						channeling the memory of my mother’s hair sticking to her damp forehead, or the bulletproof
						glass from a decade prior. I was working in a much safer area in addition to making a decent
						wage of 3 cents per plate washed. Windows down and on the way to deposit my day’s salary at 2AM,
						was a moment when I came closer to understanding my parents’ sacrifice and devotion for the
						family. </p>
					<p>While my parents may both be apologetic for not being consistently present for much of my
						siblings and my childhood, their example enabled me to acknowledge the power of grit and
						persistence. It is a privilege to understand the value of hard work and recognize the struggle
						of my parents as many other Korean-American valley kids were never exposed to the idea of
						hardship. I made simple mistakes such as buying expensive shoes or following the latest fashion
						trends throughout college in attempt to hide my less privileged background. Little did I know
						that my parents’ efforts would have been in vain if I were to fail to recognize the loss of
						authenticity when burying the origins of my identity.</p>
					<p>I am proud of achieving a closer resemblance to my parents.</p>

					<h2>Did you eat yet?</h2>
					<p>Agape(ἀγάπη) love</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/Golf.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>“Why can’t you be like white parents?” As a seventh grader who just spent the weekend at Jacob’s
						house, I heard a constant flow of “I love you” and “I love you too” throughout the day. I
						bicycled back home just in time for my mom’s signature spaghetti and meatballs, and I sat
						fiddling with my chopsticks until I asked, “Do you love me?” My mother stayed quiet until she
						said, “Don’t ask me those kinds of questions”.</p>
					<p>Every Korean man loves to golf. As I watched my father practice chipping in the backyard lawn, I
						faced him and imitated his swing. My parents were ecstatic at the prospect of their son becoming
						a professional golfer, and they began pouring as much time and money as they could into my
						junior golf career. Dad brought home golf balls that he bought from the owner of the range that
						he frequented, while mom trespassed beyond our property fence to pick up the balls that flew
						over. Hole 11 at Knollwood Golf Course, a cramped par 3 with a sharp cart-path-roundabout, will
						forever be my most cherished part of the course. Distracted and with no belts in the golf cart,
						I flew out onto the cart path due to the g forces in the roundabout. After this incident, my
						father held my hand whenever we rode together.</p>
					<p>I returned home from UCSD and visited my father at the restaurant. He stuffed my face with the
						Galbi that he marinated especially for me. As I ate, he displayed a concerned look since he knew
						I wasn’t eating enough at school. After dinner, he brought me back into the kitchen to give me a
						suitcase that he packed full of ramen and canned food. I loaded the suitcase into the car and
						waved goodbye when he called my name. Confidently, with his broken english, he told me, “I Lub
						You”.</p>
					<p>In my last year at UCSD, I had a minor allergic reaction to some gatorade protein bars that I
						scoffed down. I was tutoring Nabiha, when I was having difficulty breathing and noticed hives
						forming at the base of my hairline. I rushed out of the library to find the nearest road for an
						ambulance to pick me up and notified my mother at 8pm via text that I was going to the hospital.
						When I was discharged at 10pm, she was at my dorm. As she hugged me, I noticed her damp hands
						and lower back. My mother, one of the least capable drivers, frantically drove 130 miles to
						ensure I was okay. Walking with me back to her car, my mother opens the trunk and hands me a
						duffel bag. It was packed with food.</p>
					<p>It’s a common theme in Asian culture to show love through other ways than vocal expression. Often
						times, it’s known that “Did you eat yet?” directly translates to “I love you” in asian cultures.
						It is undeniably difficult for Asian-Americans to come to terms with the idea of non-vocal
						reassurance of their parents’ love. However, once we grasp the idea that love is communicated
						differently across cultures, we form an undying appreciation for our parents for showing us more
						love than just saying “I love you”.</p>

					<h2>¿Sabes que?</h2>
					<p>Cultural Identity In Los Angeles</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/Korea.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>My parents placed Korean culture at the top of the priority list for my siblings and me. We went
						to the cemetery several times a year to bow to our ancestors and pour rice wine around their
						tombstones. We celebrated the lunar new year with a morning full of incense and open doors to
						welcome ancestral spirits to feast on the food that my mom and grandma prepared over the span of
						several nights. We made a family pilgrimage to Korea to celebrate the death anniversary of my
						grandpa. Even though my family practiced traditional Korean culture, there was always a
						disconnect since I was not a native Korean. During my family’s pilgrimage, I wandered onto the
						soccer field in front of the hotel, and quickly began playing with the kids, until I was ousted
						for my accent. “Yankee” is what the Korean kids called me for being born in America and was no
						longer welcomed to play with them.</p>
					<p>“Mama. Por que se están comiendo nuestra comida?” My mother and I were eating tacos rancheros in
						South Central Los Angeles after closing the liquor store. The hispanic girl’s mother quickly
						scolded her for her question, but my mom gave the little girl a smile. Although my family was
						proudly Korean, we began adopting the city’s culture as a whole. We seamlessly filled the areas
						of disconnect with different foods and experiences. Huevos con chorizo for breakfast, Kimchi
						tacos for lunch, sushi burritos for dinner.</p>
					<p>I was a transfer from UCSD who quickly learned that I was behind for not having an internship in
						the first two weeks of school. On the way to an internship interview, I entered a tunnel that
						took me through to the other side of Treasure Island and instinctively honked my horn and revved
						my motorcycle in the tunnel, but there was no reciprocation from other drivers. Angelinos
						collectively understand that a tunnel is a place to bring out each other’s inner child or to
						release the day’s frustrations by furiously honking and revving our engines.</p>
					<p>Berkeley’s harsh academic standards often required my roommates and me to lock ourselves in the
						dorm to study without distractions. “La Sopa De Tu Propio Chocolate”, a song I heard in the
						Curry house on Telegraph Avenue the night before, came to mind. Alan looked down onto me from
						his top bunk when he heard the characteristic deep bass and high yelps of the Banda and it
						seemed as though we instantaneously recognized the Angelino in one another. We understood each
						other.</p>
					<p>My experiences with being called yankee by the kids I saw most similar to my physical appearance
						or being questioned by a hispanic girl on why Asians were eating Mexican food has made me
						extremely grateful for growing up in a melting pot of families. I believe that our likeness was
						not through the Banda that played throughout our dorm, but through the mutual understanding that
						we represented the character that is based on community and acceptance, in the city that is as
						multicultural as Los Angeles.</p>

					<h2>Grandmother</h2>
					<p>Unconditional Devotion</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/gma.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>There was no secret that I was my grandma’s favorite. Somehow, we always managed to be by each
						other’s side with her
						hand in mine. She made whatever food that my tiny soul desired including my favorite Korean
						dessert; sweet rice
						punch. It seemed as though she devoted much of her existence to my siblings and me(mostly me).
						In the mornings, we
						walked across the street into the neighboring cul de sac where we enjoyed the roses lined along
						the sidewalk. We sat
						and talked to one another about what I wanted for lunch. After lunch, it was time for practice.
						With grandma as my
						only spectator, I practiced my chip shot until my hands were blistered. We watched Wheels of
						Fortune together on
						channel 7, and the occasional telemarketer called and disturbed our peace. She picked up and
						said, “bankruptcy” and
						quickly hung up. There was no question that grandma was my best friend.</p>
					<p>I went with grandma to her Doctor’s appointment in Koreatown and upon entering the office, I was
						distracted by the
						sheer number of patients. I let go of her hand, but I knew exactly how to track her. Almost as
						charismatic as her
						personality, her yellow topaz ring shimmered in a large crowd. I tugged on her shirt before
						looking up to see that
						it was another Korean grandmother. I had to devise a new method to track my grandma.</p>
					<p>She spent much of her time at the sewing machine. My sister and I were active and always running
						around and
						consequently had a stockpile of socks with holes in the heel and toe. As she aged, she could no
						longer strain her
						eyes to thread the needle in her sewing machine and depended on us for help. While my sister and
						I watched the
						newest spongebob episodes, my grandma called us from the room. She alternated between “Gim Gu”
						and “Gim Narang”; and
						whoever she called, rushed down the hall to assist her.</p>
					<p>In 2007, my grandma was tending to her pepper plants and tripped along the stones that bordered
						the garden. She broke
						her hip. Soon after this incident, my parents were having increasing difficulties maintaining
						not only their
						business, but also their marriage. As a result, my grandma was sent to a nursing home where she
						developed
						Alzheimers. I was fortunate enough that her Alzheimers took the form of short term memory
						impairment since she was
						still able to recognize her best friend. It was painful to converse with her because she could
						not remember the
						questions she had asked five minutes earlier. However, in grandma like fashion, she never failed
						to ask me if I ate.
					</p>
					<p>She passed away in 2011.</p>
					<p>A few years later at UCSD, I formed an extraordinarily guilty conscience. I dreamed about her
						often and thought about
						her while studying, and I was haunted with the regret that I did not visit her more often.
						Whenever I visited, her
						face and eyes brightened as she did not see me for weeks or months at a time. The thought that I
						did not allow her
						the happiness of my presence as she had given me for the entirety of my childhood brought me to
						tears. I often
						wondered how she passed her time in a nursing home where no one understood Korean; where no one
						could understand her
						desires, or her basic human needs. I’m sure she wondered where I was and what I was doing for
						much of her day. Even
						whilst being alone in the nursing home, and unable to see me at moments notice, she seemed to
						express a sincere
						understanding for not visiting her more often.</p>

					<h2>막내 (magnae)</h2>
					<p>Cultural Identity In Los Angeles</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/magnae.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>고구려(高句麗; Goguryeo) existed in the korean peninsula from the first to seventh century. In an
						overly patriotic fashion, my father named his kids after the dynasty. Ko(brother), Rea(sister),
						Narang(sister), and me. The name “Narang” is a combination of the words “Nara Sarang” which
						directly translates to “love the land(nation)”. For most of my life, I grew up with Narang. We
						were born a year and a half apart from one another and Ko and Rea are my half siblings who are 7
						and 8 years older respectively. Narang and I often traveled to Diamond bar with my father to
						visit Ko and Rea and without fail, we always visited chuck e cheese's. When I was in the second
						grade, Ko and Rea’s mother had passed away and they moved in with our father, my mother, narang,
						and me.</p>
					<p>Our bond as siblings was unlike any other. My childhood after Ko and Rea moved in seemed to rush
						by as much of our time was spent in laughter and excitement. Ko and Rea were undoubtedly busy
						high school students, but they always found time for their younger siblings. It was an
						exhilarating feeling to share many of the same high school teachers as Ko. We shared much of the
						same interests in the sciences, while both sisters were enamoured in the arts. I had several
						paths laid out before me as I could follow the direction of three other siblings. Being the
						magnae(last born), it was my responsibility to learn from my siblings' mistakes and experiences.
						Although I am truly privileged to have three older siblings to show me the best possible path to
						pave for myself, my father seems to have a conflicting traditional sense of family dynamic that
						counters the idea of being the beneficiary of my siblings. Korean culture places most emphasis
						on the success of the first born daughter or first born son; to have a younger child surpass the
						accomplishments of older siblings is thought to “throw off the balance”. It’s a strange sense to
						have expectations to either be a carbon copy of an older sibling, or to be “lesser”.</p>
					<p>The most important takeaway from this traditional hierarchical family dynamic is to understand
						its differences to American values. American families tend to dismiss the idea of favoritism
						regarding their children’s successes, as success is thought to have a subjective definition.
						However, success possesses a much more concrete definition in Korean culture: wealth, or the
						possibility of a comfortable livelihood. In rural Korea, to place most investment on the
						first-born maximizes the probability of a quicker return. This idea to place most emphasis on
						the first child may have been an effective investment strategy in Goguryeo, but only creates
						unnecessary family drama in the Kim family today. It's commonplace for all of us to butt heads
						regarding who claims the throne of “having their act together”.</p>

					<h2>Cans and Bottles</h2>
					<p>How much a dollar cost?</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/me2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>My family always collected and recycled bottles. Visiting home from UCSD, I scrunched water
						bottles and packed them into my duffel bag since I did not have a car to go to a recycling
						center near campus. Once I got home, I drove my family’s decade old Hyundai to pick up several
						bags that contained green soju bottles from my father’s restaurant along with a basket full of
						bottles that piled up at my mother’s house. I collected on average 20-30 dollars that covered
						the train cost to visit home. It was a strange moment at UCSD since my two closest friends did
						not possess the same mindset. Hannam and Justin were both from well off families that did not
						have recycling in their repertoire. Walking back to the apartment from the on campus market, we
						passed by a crushed Starbucks Mocha Can. Even whilst being with my best friends, I feared that
						if I were to pick up the crushed can, I would be labeled as a person who was less fortunate.
						Cans reap the most money at a recycling center at a whopping 10 cents, so I picked up the can
						the next morning while there was no one around to see. Much of my sophomore year was wasted in
						attempt to blend in with my peers who wore expensive clothes and followed Hypebeast trends. Now
						I see the irony in recycling bottles and cans to fund a $120 shoe purchase.</p>
					<p>I was a junior transfer at UC Berkeley when I decided to rush an Asian fraternity. At the end of
						rush week, there was an event that took me to Origin NightClub in San Francisco. While I was
						talking with the brothers in line, there were dollar bills scattered around the floor. I ignored
						the dollar bills in the same fashion that I ignored the crushed mocha can and doing so elicited
						much of the same feelings. I was embarrassed to pick up the dollars to preserve my reputation in
						front of the brothers.</p>
					<p>Mom always reminded me of how large a dollar can be despite social status. Although a dollar may
						be a seemingly insignificant amount, it holds most of its value in reminding me of humbler
						beginnings. A dollar reminds me to practice gratitude for the people and experiences that helped
						me grow. These instances also allow me to form an appreciation for people who aren’t afraid of
						judgement and those who regularly practice humility. My mother would never pass by a dime on the
						floor and she owns a house. Why should I ignore a can when I own nothing?</p>

					<h2>Familiarity in the unfamiliar</h2>
					<p>Closer than we think</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="" alt="" /></span>
					<p>"Finding familiarity in the unfamiliar" is a concept that is often discussed when people
						encounter new experiences, such as starting a new job or moving to a new place. For some, it is
						the ability to relate to their new surroundings and make it feel like home. For me, finding
						familiarity in the unfamiliar is all about connecting with people.
					</p>

					<p>
						When most people talk about finding familiarity in the unfamiliar, it can be during moments such
						as finding a new job, moving to another country, or learning something new. Finding familiarity
						in the unfamiliar lets people feel a sense of comfort, security, or even a sense of direction.
						For instance, when a person moves to a new country, they try to relate their experiences and
						knowledge of their home to the new place that they live. It helps them navigate further into
						their new place, and lets them feel that there really is not much difference between the two.
					</p>

					<p>To me, finding familiarity in the unfamiliar involves interacting with people. I find it most
						satisfying to connect with people by not seeing them as strangers. I try to draw parallels
						between that person and people in my life. By doing this, I feel like I have much more wholesome
						and thorough conversations and the ability to express myself as I am.
					</p>

					<p>I was driving to school and noticed that the tire pressure monitor alert had gone off. I got off
						the freeway and went to a nearby Costco to fill up the air. There was a woman in her 50s who was
						also trying to fill air in her tires at the air pump next to mine. It looked as if she was
						concerned and wanted some help from workers at the tire center, but all of them were too busy to
						assist her. I could have simply filled up my tires and been on my way, but I felt a sense of
						responsibility to ask her if she needed help. She reminded me of my own mother. She drove the
						same Lexus SUV and had the same expeditious walk that almost every Asian mom seems to have. When
						I asked her if she needed help, her face lit up and she asked me how much she should inflate her
						tires. I asked her to sit in her car and turn it on so she could navigate to the tire pressure
						menu. I also showed her the recommended fill pressure that is located on the side of her door. I
						taught her these things, in the same way I would teach my mom. I filled her four tires, and
						after I was done, she told me that her son was my age and that I reminded her of him. We saw
						familiarity in one another as total strangers. However, I felt that our interaction was much
						more meaningful and thorough than if I were to help her in the manner of teaching a stranger.
					</p>
					<p>I was riding my motorcycle around Berkeley. I had finished my classes for the week, so I had a
						few hours to ride up to Grizzly Peak. As I came down the mountain, I decided to ride around the
						downtown area of Berkeley for the ambiance. As I turned the corner to ride down Telegraph
						Avenue, I noticed a child looking at me and waving profusely. I saw him out of the corner of my
						eye, so I couldn’t wave back in time. I decided to turn the corner again and make my way around
						to the one-way street that he was on. I rode up to him and gestured for him to come and rev the
						motorcycle. He was unsure at first, but then I remembered that I was wearing a black leather
						race suit with a black helmet, and I realized that I might look intimidating to a four or
						five-year-old. I raised my visor and showed a smile through my eyes. His grandpa was with him,
						holding his hand, and he gave his grandson reassurance and gestured for him to rev the
						motorcycle. The boy, who was no taller than the handlebars of the bike, reached up and twisted
						the throttle. He scared himself with how loud the motorcycle was, and his grandpa laughed as we
						shared a wholesome moment. The grandpa reached out his hand in the gesture of a high-five, so I
						held up my hand, and he grasped it. He did one of those Gordon Ramsay high-five handholds
						instead of a high-five. He came close and said, “Thank you.”
					</p>
					<p>Finding familiarity in the unfamiliar can be a rewarding experience, especially when it comes to
						connecting with others. By drawing parallels between strangers and people in my life, I can make
						meaningful connections that go beyond the surface level. My encounters with a woman filling air
						in her tires and a child waving at me while I was riding my motorcycle are perfect examples of
						how finding familiarity in the unfamiliar can lead to wholesome and memorable interactions. In a
						world where strangers are often viewed with suspicion and caution, finding familiarity in the
						unfamiliar is a refreshing reminder of the kindness that exists in people.</p>
