									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>Aquamen was a dorm room idea that I pursued in my Junior year at Berkeley. Implementing knowledge of the nitrogen cycle, choosing the correct correlated color temperature light for optimum leaf growth, and minimizing production costs through the dorm’s free utilities, I grew dwarf water lettuce, guppy grass, pearl weed, and java fern, in two-ten gallon fish tanks. With recycled boxes and plastic bags from the optometrist’s office, I distributed aquarium plants throughout the States with eBay. Leading my own project enabled me to practice leadership skills by designating tasks to my roommates, whether it be for monthly maintenance or sending shipments to the post office.</p>

									<h2>Business Strategy</h2>
									<p> There are a few suppliers that have accreditation with tens of thousands of reviews and started a full time operation with full fledged facilities. However, the aquarium plant market on ebay is dominated by independent suppliers.  A key method to gain a position in the market as a new player is to undercut competitor prices until the project gains momentum through buyer reviews. One aspect of cheaper aquarium plants that most aquarists are cautious of are snails; often, the cheaper aquarium plants have snails that are detrimental to aquariums. Thus, one area I emphasized was the idea that the plants were snail free, while providing customers with pictures before their order to provide them with assurance and confidence. Snail-free emphasis is also prioritized since one of our tanks, “10-gal-dirty” was utilized as a snail treatment tank, and the other “10-gal-clean” contained plants that were snail free and ready for processing and shipment. </p>

									<h2>Biggest Challenge</h2>
									<p>The most difficult time during the operation was a fungal infection found only in the dwarf water lettuce. Up to the moment that the fungal infection struck, the most grossing product was the dwarf water lettuce which was priced at $1.50 per plant.  Unfortunately, I was not able to identify and remove the source of the fungal infection which would ultimately jeopardize all of my water lettuce stock. Fortunately, the fungus did not affect the guppy grass, Najas Guadalupenis, which soon became our most grossing product.</p>

									<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
									<p>The biggest takeaway from the Aquamen Project was the idea of urgency in customer satisfaction. While I was eating at the Crossroads near my dorm, I received a message from a customer from Houston that did not receive his package. Understanding the customer and prioritizing his order for immediate shipment was essential. I provided the customer with a free second shipment, along with tracking on his package so that he would be reassured that we were trying our best to provide the best possible service. Even though the project seemed like a relaxed hobby to those who were not involved, our efforts to satisfy the needs of customers was on par with our commitment to our studies and internships. It is an extremely satisfying feeling to be able to obtain an order, package the plants via wet paper towels, and purchase shipping labels to send out the package via priority shipping to the customer. My dorm-mates and I took shifts dropping off the small rectangular boxes at the post office down on Durant street. I felt as though I participated in an effort that was not only satisfying, but also aided in my ability to formulate a plan, gain a sense of the aquatic plant market, and begin operations. </p>
