									<h2>"Why transfer?"</h2>
									<p>I was fortunate enough to be admitted to UCSD, considering that my highschool statistics were less than outstanding. I was a track and field athlete with a 4.27 GPA and 1780/2400 SAT. When I first stepped onto the UCSD campus, I thought that transferring to another UC was out of the question, but I set myself up with a goal of transferring because I felt that I did not pair well with the school. The contrast of my SAT score and highschool gpa was an indicator to me that I undoubtedly invested little effort into the standardized test and could redeem myself by working hard in the classroom. UC reciprocity required me to finish all lower division requirements for both my major and Eleanor Roosevelt College and upon completion, I applied to UC Berkeley with a 3.9 GPA.</p>

									<h2>UC San Diego</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/SD.jpeg" alt="" /></span><p>The first two years of my undergraduate degree was at UC San Diego where I majored in General Biology. The recombinant DNA techniques lab at UCSD(BIMM101) inspired me to delve into Molecular and Cell Biology after transferring to UC Berkeley.</p>
									<p>My social experience at UCSD was lackluster since I only focused on transferring. With the thought that I was a temporary Triton, I was not involved with campus clubs nor with academic labs. Later, I would come to realize the detrimental effects of neglecting internship opportunities in favor of an elevated GPA. </p>
									
									<h3>Recombinant DNA Techniques Lab (BIMM 101)</h3>
									<p>The Lab encompassed PCR, DNA Sequencing, bioinformatics, and RNA analysis and knowledge of bacterial digestion with restriction enzymes, ligation, and transformation. The class was my first exposure to lab practices surrounding recombinant DNA in E. Coli. The final project was a ligation of GFP into E. Coli plasmids, which were then transformed into the bacteria.</p>

									<h2>UC Berkeley</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/berk2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I would not hesitate to say that UC Berkeley was a humbling experience. UC Berkeley students seem to have an appetite for destroying their competitors. My first semester at UC Berkeley was, to say the least, a hectic mess. With my chin held high, I believed my performance from UC San Diego was an indicator of how I would perform at Berkeley, but soon realized my mistake when I decided to pursue an internship on top of a 16-unit schedule. The worst part about the experience was the feeling that I was behind my peers, but I understood that stiff competition helped me grow at an accelerated pace. Another difficult adjustment was the switch from the quarter to semester system. My time at UC Berkeley also enabled me to recognize the significance of computer science in biology(everyone seemed to be a CS major at Berkeley) and the importance of self-start projects.</p>

												<h3>Molecular and Cell Biology Lab (MCB170L)</h3>
												<p>With Instructor Isabelle Le Blanc, I was able to work with E. Coli and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and practiced laboratory techniques such as plasmid purification and fluorescence microscopy. The final project was an analysis of enzymatic activities between ScCin8P and commercial kinesin. The lab emphasized a deep understanding of the relationship of microtubules and actin in their roles in mitosis. The lab consisted of techniques such as protein purification, assay through elution fractions, Bradford and Malachite Green assays, COOMASSIE Staining and Western Blot.</p>

												<h3>Immunology (MCB150)</h3>
												<p>I gained a thorough understanding of T cells: T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17) and important experimental conditions such as MyD88-/- and inducers (IFNùù≤, IL-4, and IL-23). I learned about T cell receptor structure and function and understanding of KO such as Œ≤2Microglobulin-/-. The class encompassed the roles of T cells in immune response, allergy, autoimmunity, and tumors.</p>
